# ARies

## Description

Recollection of 2040 pushing the idea of ARies-themed prismatic gear watch face, featuring:
- Vivid background shooting the sky between day, afternoon, eve, and night
- Power stripe hinting the battery status which is placed as date/clock board
- ★★★ (Read:Hoshimitsu) goal of the day, marking how much you've walked through the day. Keep walking and reach your step goal to get full rate of 3 stars.
- Hexagon particle mapping animation calculating hypothetically artificial augmentation by seconds

Stripe indicator (battery percentage):
- 0-25: red
- 26-50: yellow
- 51-75: blue
- 76-100: green

Star indicator (step percentage):
- 0-14: 0 star filled
- 15-29: 0.5 star filled
- 30-44: 1 star filled
- 45-59: 1.5 stars filled
- 60-75: 2 stars filled
- 76-99: 2.5 stars filled
- 100: Hoshimitsu!

## Update

v3.0: Replace per-hour hexagon spots with per-second hexagon particles mapping animation.

v2.0: New power stripe looping the day of the week. You don't have to squeeze yout eyes to look at that barely readable text now.
